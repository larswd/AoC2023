# Advent of code 2023
This is my code attempting to solve advent of code 2023. Hopefully, I will manage to do all the exercises. Currently, all input files are stored in
the input folder with the following naming scheme ```dayXpY``` being the input file for day X part Y. All utility functions are stored in ```utils.h```/```utils.c```. 
To run, simply compile the makefile by writing ```make``` in your terminal while in the AoC2023 directory.
